Branch: ralph/daily-activity-widget
Started: (pending first run)

## 2026-01-12 - US-001
- What was implemented: Fixed trip dates from 2026 to 2025 as specified in PRD requirements
- Files changed: app/lib/tripDates.ts
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - The tripDates.ts file already existed with full implementation (getTripDay, getDaysUntilTrip, isTripComplete, getTripStatus functions)
  - Only needed to fix the year from 2026 to 2025 to match PRD spec
  - The utility already supports optional `now` parameter for testing different dates

## 2026-01-12 - US-002
- What was implemented: Verified existing getActivitiesByDay query in convex/itinerary.ts meets all acceptance criteria
- Files changed: None (implementation already existed)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - The getActivitiesByDay query was already implemented from a previous feature
  - It uses the by_day index on activities table for efficient querying
  - Vote aggregation follows same pattern as getItinerary: collect votes, reduce to get totals
  - Sorting uses timeSlotOrder object pattern for consistent Morning → Afternoon → Evening ordering
